# AMLdb
AMLdb (Acute Myeloid Leukemia Database) is a comprehensive resource for researchers studying AML. It provides valuable insights into transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics, etiology, biomarkers, and novel gene targets associated with AML.

# Features
- Transcriptional and Epigenetic Data: Explore curated data on gene expression and epigenetic modifications in AML.
- Etiology and Biomarkers: Understand the underlying causes of AML and discover relevant biomarkers.
- Drug Sensitivity Information: Access information on drug responses and personalized treatment options.
- Mutational Analysis: Investigate genetic mutations associated with AML.
- Identified Gene Targets: Explore the gene targets associated with AML. We provide information on genes implicated in AML pathogenesis.
